In order to test Getdeck completely **free** and easily we are providing with a free Kubernetes cluster that you can spin up using Getdeck and use as you please. The following details are valid for that Cluster:

## Specs for the free cluster:
* max. 4h cluster lifetime
* no session timeout
* max. 3 nodes (max. 2 cores, 6GB RAM, 50GB Storage)
* max. 1 cluster at a time

Please note, we have limited ressources available for this free setup. If there are many users trying to run a cluster at the same time, you may not be able to spin up a new cluster and waiting time may be involved.

> If you like Getdeck, please give us a ‚≠ê star on [GitHub and support this project](https://github.com/Getdeck/beiboot).
