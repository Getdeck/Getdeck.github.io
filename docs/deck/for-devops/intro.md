# Introduction for DevOps or Kubernetes Operators
You are probably already mastering Kubernetes and all its strings attached.To lower the pressure on
the Kubernetes experts within development teams, Getdeck promotes the approach to _fail fast during development_.
Things that do not work as expected in a local Kubernetes-based development environments won't probably work on 
_integration_ or _production_, too. However, developers main task is writing code, not dealing with complex operations (or
cloudy) infrastructure.   
Getdeck is here to lower the access for developers to set up Kubernetes-based development
infrastructure and hence make your life easier, too. Simply put some effort in providing [Deckfiles](/docs/deckfile/specs)
to your development teams.
