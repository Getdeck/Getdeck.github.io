# Introduction for DevOps or Kubernetes Operators
You are probably already mastering Kubernetes and all its strings attached.

To lower the pressure on the Kubernetes experts within development teams, Getdeck promotes the approach 
to _fail fast during development_. Things that do not work as expected in a local Kubernetes-based development 
environment won't work on _integration_ or _production_, too. Yet, developers main task is writing code, 
not dealing with complex operations (or cloudy) infrastructure.

<hr/>

Getdeck is here to lower the access for developers to set up Kubernetes-based development
infrastructure and hence make DevOps' life easier, too. Simply put some effort in providing 
[Deckfiles](/docs/deckfile-specs/) to your development teams by reusing the Kubernetes workload manifests you already have.
