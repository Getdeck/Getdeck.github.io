title: Hello World from Getdeck

* I want to see the entire workflow for getting my Hello World service defined in Deck, running in a cluster locally, deployed to a production cluster, and managed in a gitops-style workflow
* I want to see what the files look like, what commands I'll run, and how it'll all hook together
* Assume I'm not a k8s expert (I'm not) who can infer how this will work, because I shouldn't need to be to create a basic system
* Without more specifics on how the devops and devex look, I have to spend a lot of time trying things out myself and documenting my analysis to share with my coworkers

*  I desperately want something that can define the composition of my entire cluster, but not require major time and infrastructure investment
